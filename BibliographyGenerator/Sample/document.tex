	I used to be a chemist, studying strontium in enamel
	\cite{strontiummottling,stablestrontium}. Then I worked
	at SAS in North Carolina, and gave talks at their
	meetings\cite{sugirepeated}. At UC Berkeley, I wrote
	tech reports\cite{xrandom}, research papers\cite{wic},
	and a book\cite{datamanipulation}.
